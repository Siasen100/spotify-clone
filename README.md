# spotify-clone
I am having a hard time uploading my react projects onto Github. That's why I have introduced the whole project into a drive . I will add images of these projects to get more view. This is done by pulling my Spotify account information. When I play music in my actual Spotify account. This clone will pull the information and show the song which I am playing.
